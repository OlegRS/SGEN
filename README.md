SGEN (Stochastic Gene Expression in Neurons) is a high-performance library for computing distributions of mRNAs and proteins in arbitrary neurons. The core of the library is written in C++ and wrapped in Python. The library is meant to be used through the SGEN_Py Python module (see ./python_examples) but could be used directly in C++ (see ./cpp_examples).

## Installation
To install the library, clone the repository and run ./setup.sh.
