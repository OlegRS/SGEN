    "## About\n",
    "SGEN_Py (Stochastic Gene Expression in Neurons) is a Python module allowing computing the first and second moments of active gene, mRNA and protein counts everywhere in arbitrary neurons. It does so by solving a linear stochastic model of gene->mRNA->protein dynamics. The module can also be used to run Monte Carlo simulation of the underlying stochastic process, which can be used as a generative model of protein noise. However, the real strength of this software is its ability to obtain expectations and correlations of all variables in the model without expensive Monte Carlo simulation. \n",
